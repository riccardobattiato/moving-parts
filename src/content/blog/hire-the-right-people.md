## The most common advice
Yesterday I stumbled upon an [interesting discussion]((https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1bh5rrl/how_do_you_manage_a_team_of_developers/)) on Reddit: someone was asking for advice about managing a team of developers. [Many](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1bh5rrl/comment/kvbuugp/) [answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1bh5rrl/comment/kvcf2sd/) suggested that the most important thing is that you hire the "right" people. However, I feel like this sentence, although shared by many, could have different meanings for each of us.

When I say you should hire the right people, what I really mean is **you should hire someone you can _trust_**. There are a few key areas I prioritize most when trying to understand if I'd [trust someone](https://www.fearlessculture.design/blog-posts/control-less-trust-more) with my team's work:
1. Their judgement;
2. Their responsibility;
3. Their growth process.

## Judgement, or thought process
> Before you code, think. Before you write, read. Before you speak, listen. Before you comment, reflect. Before you release, test.

--Addy Osmani <sup>[1](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/679739-before-you-code-think-before-you-write-read-before-you)</sup>

The most important thing I try to grasp when looking for someone to work with is their **thought process**. While [judgment](https://nav.al/judgment) and thought process are two different things, I tend to consider them two sides of the same coin -- good judgment is the result of methodical, flexible thought process applied to one's own experience.

Generally speaking, good thought process means someone is comfortable both in the **analysis** of a new problem or concept -- in order to gradually build a solid _understanding_ -- and the **synthesis** of an answer or an original solution.

One of the signs of an elegant thought process is usually **the propensity to know the _whys_ behind the _how tos_** that generally constitute the expertise of a competent, skillful person. Ultimately, good thought process and judgement will make it easier for you to [trust someone enough](/posts/what-i-learned-about-management#trust-is-a-two-way-street) to [let them do their job](/posts/what-i-learned-about-management##modulating-your-absence).

## Responsibility
> Taking ownership of a project doesn't mean you own it – it means you care about your role and the overall outcome. Taking ownership is a commitment. You feel responsible to yourself, not just others.

--Gustavo Razzetti <sup>[2](https://www.fearlessculture.design/blog-posts/how-to-create-an-ownership-mentality-within-your-team)</sup>

While judgment is in my opinion the largest contributor to a person's decision-making process, **responsibility** is another important key element that will make the difference when working on any project. A responsible person is someone that will take a certain degree of **ownership of their own work**.

Responsibility is often evident when discussing a person’s choices or evaluating their decision-making process. It shows if **they feel in control**, especially in the context of the classic _reactive versus proactive_ mindset. In my opinion, behaviors of reactivity or proactivity in someone only are _the result_ of their sense of responsibility and ownership of a project.

Responsibility is the biggest contributor to trust, even when a person's judgement has not yet fully developed, maybe due to lack of experience.

## Growth process
> Remember, always, that everything you know, and everything everyone knows, is only a model.

--Donella Meadows <sup>[3](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/528565-remember-always-that-everything-you-know-and-everything-everyone-knows)</sup>

Last but not least: growth. A person who shows a sincere interest to grow instantly has my curiosity, but one that has the mindset of the **perpetual learner** has my full attention.

A person who's able to grow is someone who's able to constantly **question themselves and their ideas**, which is, in my opinion, the only real key to developing a true _"growth mindset"_ -- a term that has become so popular, but maybe is not so well understood.

A person who is able to grow is someone you can trust with *your own growth*. You will discuss problems, solutions, projects, companies and always be sure that both of you will come away enriched by it.

Speaking of mentality, there’s so much more at play when trying to hire the right people. Gustavo Razzetti, CEO of Fearless Culture, wrote an [interesting piece](https://www.fearlessculture.design/blog-posts/how-to-upgrade-your-mindset-for-success) which delves more into detail.
