## The most common advice
Yesterday I stumbled upon an [interesting discussion]((https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1bh5rrl/how_do_you_manage_a_team_of_developers/)) on Reddit: someone was asking for advice about managing a team of developers. [Many](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1bh5rrl/comment/kvbuugp/) [answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1bh5rrl/comment/kvcf2sd/) suggested that the most important thing is that you hire the "right" people. However, I feel like this sentence, although shared by many, could have different meanings for each of us.

The fact is, I take the sentence "hire the right people" *literally*. You're hiring not only a developer, a teammate, a professional -- you're asking a person to come work with/for you. When I say "hire the right **_people_**" I mean a few things that are mostly summarized by "hire the right *human beings*".

Here are some of the traits I try to look for when I'm interviewing someone.

## Independence of thought
The most important thing I try to understand when meeting a potential hire is their degree of **autonomous reasoning** -- the ability to think for oneself -- and **critical thinking**. You can typically grasp this from a simple chat about anything non-trivial, like a problem they solved or something new they've learned.

More often than not, a good sign of original thinking is the habit of knowing the _whys_ behind the many _how tos_ any skilled person may already master.

A skilled person may solve known problems easily and learn how to solve unknown ones. However, **an original thinker will innovate** and bring true value to the table.


## Responsibility
[A mentality of ownership](https://www.fearlessculture.design/blog-posts/how-to-create-an-ownership-mentality-within-your-team) is one of the key ingredients to having a positive team experience producing quality results and, most importantly, quality working life. It will be easier to build one when the people working with you all share some degree of **responsibility regarding their own work** -- especially when it comes to their own **learning**. I also personally like when people are responsible and feel like they are the ones in charge of their own lives, despite what life may throw at them.

Responsibility can be often seen when discussing a person's choices, allowing you to glimpse into their **decision-making process** while trying to grasp their tendency to *moving actively* versus *reacting passively* in the context of their learning path, a project they've worked on, their company or their entire life.

Finally, a person who's responsible is [a person you can trust](/posts/what-i-learned-about-management#trust-is-a-two-way-street).

## Growth mindset
Last but not least, one of the most popular concepts in blogs and social media: **growth mindset**. A tricky one, since it's not that easy to tell when someone does truly possess it.

In short, growth mindset boils down to one's **attitude towards failure**. To have a growth mindset means that in case of failure, the opportunity for learning is almost always clear; a growth-ready person is confident about their ability to learn from their mistakes and experience.

On the other hand, not having a growth mindset usually means that a person will **blame someone** for their failure -- others, or themselves. 

People possessing a growth mindset will likely grow the most because they'll generally be more ready to learn.
