description: Saying no to 1,000 things and the courage to create
---

In the end, I did it.

I have wanted to start blogging for years, but procrastination has always stopped me. Too many ideas, too many possibilities, a dark ocean from which one rarely pulls out the things he initially sought. Any project can be everything and nothing at the same time, before you decide to ["say no to 1,000 things"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8eP99neOVs) and find the courage to create.

Giving names perfectly embodies this dilemma, when you have something not trivial on your hands. I originally wanted to name this blog _"The Product Minded Developer"_, because I like [the concept from Gergely Orosz](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/) and the domain name _productminded.dev_ is really cool. Could anything have been better for a dev blog? Unfortunately, that domain was taken just a few weeks ago.

So I went with _moving parts_. Aside from the obvious [mention to engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_parts), I feel like anything worth exploring and studying is composed of moving parts -- and is itself part of another system.

I'd like this blog to be about any type of system or, as [Donella Meadows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_In_Systems:_A_Primer) might have put, _"any set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something"_ -- whether useful or entertaining.

Happy reading, and I hope that this blog can be _useful or entertaining_ to you!
