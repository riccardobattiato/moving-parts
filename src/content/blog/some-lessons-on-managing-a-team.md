description: It's been more than two years since when I went from being an individual contributor to delegating most of the coding, refining processes and hiring people. Here's a few things I've learned.

More than two years ago I was working full time as a frontend developer at [mono](https://mono.studio/en/), a web agency based in southern Italy. A few successful projects led to a fairly rapid general growth, which meant I had the opportunity to take on a leadership role and see things from a different perspective.

After a few years choosing what to delegate and to whom, what to deal with personally, who to hire in order to design a sensible team while at the same time trying to keep growing myself technically, I've learned some things. Most of them may be obvious to many, but have been insightful to me when I learned them from within, a "bottom-up" learning process that hits differently than the plethora of Medium etc. articles providing sound but sometimes sterile advice.
