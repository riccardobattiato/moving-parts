description: The CSS property mix-blend-mode is a classic visual effect for logos, making them contrast nicely with the background of a web page...
---

One of the coolest CSS effects I know, used by many websites since when it started being supported by modern browsers, is the `mix-blend-mode: difference` property. It's generally used on elements of sticky headers such as logos and text, since it creates a nice contrasting visual effect with the background below it as the user scrolls.

However, one of the issues developers [experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/css/comments/1542qf7/is_there_a_way_to_round_a_color_value_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) [the](https://stackoverflow.com/q/67544643/29254483) [most](https://discourse.webflow.com/t/mix-blend-mode-black-white/116734) with the property is that you can't really control the colors that the `difference` or `exclusion` between the sticky elements and the background will produce. **Specifically, how to make it so that `mix-blend-mode` will display only black or white colors**.

Today we'll see a **pure CSS solution** to this known issue that uses a combination of backdrop and normal filters. _Note: the solution is currently only supported by Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, etc.)._

## CSS filters in action

The key to the solution is simple: **the same element which blends with the background, must set a grayscale and contrast filter**. The code responsible for the effect shown in the Pen above is as simple as the following:

```css
.blending-element {
  mix-blend-mode: difference;
  backdrop-filter: grayscale(1) contrast(100); // be careful: the order matters!
  background-color: black;
}
```

Setting a background color isn't always required, but remember that **in order for `mix-blend-mode` to work, both the blending element and the background must have an actual color**. If your body looks `white` but is really `transparent`, there will be no colors to blend.

Once `mix-blend-mode` is set, you'll have the typical inverted-colors look: unless you have a perfectly black or white background, the blending element may show unwanted colors. This is where CSS filters come into action: **grayscale** will force any color into a tint of black or white, while setting a really high **contrast** value will "round" the grayscale tints to pure black or white.

You may have noticed that we're using a [**backdrop-filter**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter) rather than a [normal one](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter). There are two reasons for this:

1. First, it's becauase moving the `grayscale(1)` parameter to a normal, non-backdrop filter simply won't work. The solution is slightly hacky, and it needs for the backdrop to filter its colors to grayscale.
2. The `contrast(/* really high value here */)` on direct elements makes them look way worse. It's better to rely on the backdrop and let the `mix-blend-mode` do its job on the actual element anyway.

Relying on `backdrop-filter` has one issue: even if you have a transparent background behind your blending element, **the rectangle behind it will look black or white too**. This is fine for rectangular elements such as the simple scroller inside the CodePen example, but not for complex shapes such as the [planet logo](https://thenounproject.com/icon/planet-7302521/) from the [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/) shown in the same example.

## What about complex shapes?

There's another really useful CSS property that will solve our problem: [clip-path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path). Thanks to it, we're able to clip our visual page elements to simple shapes, custom polygons and **custom SVG paths**. The latter is the most flexible approach and the one I like the most.

1. **Get your complex shape and/or text as SVG code.** This could be an external file or an inline SVG such as in the example below.
2. Move the paths and other elements inside a `<clipPath>` definition element, as done below.
3. Set an `id="..."` for the `<clipPath>` element: the CSS code will need to reach it.

You should get something like this:

```xml
  <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" viewBox="-5.0 -10.0 110.0 135.0">

Afterwards, you need to prepare a `<div />` or other element to be the one that will be clipped by your custom path. Personally, I like to reuse my SVG as an inline element in the page, both for providing the `<clipPath>` definition _and_ for providing a visual element to clip.

If you use an empty element or an SVG which doesn't display actual elements by itself (as in my example), remember to specify a width or height you're about to clip:

```css
.complex-shape {
  width: 6.875rem; // Warning: this has to be really precise!
}
```

Once the element is in page and has some dimensions, set the `clip-path` property so that it references your SVG definition:

```css
.complex-shape {
  width: 6.875rem;
  clip-path: url(#clipping-shape);
}
```

Now you can make your black and white backdrop appear, and it will have the same shape or text from your SVG:

```css
.complex-shape {
  width: 6.875rem;
  clip-path: url(#clipping-shape);
  mix-blend-mode: difference;
  backdrop-filter: grayscale(1) contrast(100); // be careful: the order matters!
}
```

Feel free to be creative with `clip-path` â€” there are many ways to use it, and many other ways to provide a valid SVG `<clipPath>` definition.

Let me know if you have any improvements to this solution or find even easier ways to accomplish the effect!
